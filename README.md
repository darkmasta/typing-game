I will share more details:

You will be working on the development of new functionalities and legacy technologies (ReactJS).

The company has been on the market for more than 20 years - it is a full-fledged telecommunications company with 1+ million users in the Swiss market. The project is constantly being developed, new functionalities are introduced, processes are improved and technologies are updated.

This is a stable long-term project from Switzerland. Working in the European time zone, with a very strong team. There is a possible growth into tech leader within our company.

In the medium and long term, the team will be located in the office of our company in Lodz (Poland). The team is currently being staffed (currently, 5 engineers from the LaSoft side are part of the team: 1 Java, 1 PHP, 3 Ruby).

In the near future, we will hire Java engineers and JavaScript engineers.

Is a must: JavaScript skills and experience with VanillaJS, and ReactJS framework.

The possibility of relocation to Poland in the medium term in 3-6 months.

(for now, the candidate may be abroad or in Ukraine). Must have a minimum of three years of experience with selected technologies.

A business trip to the customer's office (Switzerland), the office and everything necessary at the disposal of our company, an advanced team, and close cooperation with the System Architects.

Also, I have a few questions:
- do you have a tax residence certificate? Your current location?
